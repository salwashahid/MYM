		<h3>What is the Islamic viewpoint on dating?</h3>
		<p>To get straight to the point, dating in not permissible in Islam. Period. It has been made very clear in the Quran and Hadith as to what is acceptable and what is not acceptable between boys and girls who are not married to each other. But nowadays, the Muslim ummah has started to neglect these straightforward guidelines. Muslim dating websites have started popping up, and our youth have started hanging out way more than they need to. If you’re hesitating about ending a haram relationship, then just remember that in no way, whatsoever, is dating going to bring you closer to Allah. Inshallah, with that thought in mind, you WILL be able to get over it and everything will be alright.</p>

		<h3>So, what IS permissible in Islam when it comes to dating?</h3>
		<p>Well, the first thing to point out here is that it is not haram to love, even before marriage. Love is just a feeling that may or may not be in your control. However, we will definitely be held responsible and accountable if we get carried away by our feelings and take actions that might be deemed as haram. If you have such feelings for someone, then the correct way to take action would be marriage. In fact, Islam encourages us to marry people who we feel a special affinity towards. Thus, Islam recommends that potential marriage partners see one another before proposing marriage, to create a bond between one another. This concept is called courting, or “halal dating”. By dating the halal way, you are introduced to someone through family or friends for potential marriage. Once introduced, the two people meet using preset boundaries set by the Islamic law, meaning that you meet in a public place with a chaperone. Flirting or physical contact is not allowed. These meetings are solely for the purpose of understanding one another’s personality and qualities. After going on multiple halal dates, you should have a general sense of who your potential partner is like and based on your understanding of the person, you can decide whether or not to marry them. It’s that simple (kind of)!</p>
